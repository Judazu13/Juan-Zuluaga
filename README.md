Hello! My name is Juan Daniel Zuluaga Kerguelen, (I know it is way too long and hard to pronounce xD), and my journey into cybersecurity has been shaped by a variety of experiences that have taught me the importance of problem-solving, adaptability, and attention to detail.

My background in Aviation trained me to thrive in high-pressure environments, make quick decisions, and stay calm under challenging conditions skills that are crucial when responding to security incidents. As an English teacher, I developed strong communication and organizational skills, which are essential for collaborating with teams and planning effective strategies. Working in hospitality as a chef taught me how to stay organized, maintain high standards, and keep my cool in fast paced, demanding situations. Finally, my time in the construction industry reinforced the value of precision, problem-solving, and working efficiently under tight deadlines.

These experiences have not only shaped my work ethic but also fueled my passion for cybersecurity. Iâ€™m excited to bring my diverse skill set to the field, where I can apply my problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and stay focus and composed to protect systems and respond to threats effectively.

I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My goal is to become a skilled cybersecurity professional who can tackle complex challenges and help organizations achieve their security goals. I am actively seeking a role as a Cybersecurity Analyst, Incident Responder, or Vulnerability Management Specialist to further develop my knowledge and skills while contributing to the protection of critical systems and data.
